# 🖼️ Image Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

*A Flask-based Machine Learning Web Application*

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project performs **image segmentation** using the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to divide an image into meaningful color-based regions.
It includes a **Flask REST API** for uploading images and getting segmented outputs, along with **MLflow tracking** for experiment management.

The goal is to demonstrate a **complete ML pipeline** — from image processing to deployment.

---

## 🎯 Features

* Upload any image for segmentation
* K-Means clustering for pixel grouping
* REST API built with Flask
* MLflow integration for experiment tracking
* Returns segmented image as output
* Easy to run locally

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user uploads an image
2. Image pixels are converted into numerical feature vectors
3. K-Means clusters similar pixels
4. Each pixel is reassigned based on its cluster
5. A segmented image is generated and returned
